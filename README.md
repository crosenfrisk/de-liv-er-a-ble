  ## Description
  de-liv-er-able is a back-end site for an E-Commerce business that works with Express.js and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Users can view and update the database by using Insomnia, a RESTful API client.

  ## Installation
  User must have Node.js and MySQL on their device; the application is run through the command line. It is suggested to have a tool such as Insomnia or Postman to view GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests.


  ## Usage
  To use, open application in VSC or other editor. In the terminal, login to mysql using password, then SOURCE db/schema.sql. Then quit mysql and use command line to type `npm run seed` to populate database with seeds. Using `npm start` the user can then run GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in Insomnia (or other tool like Postman) to make changes to the database.
  
  Rather than needing to write SQL queries in the command line, Sequelize runs the JavaScript seed files to create the tables from which users can view, update, and delete data.
